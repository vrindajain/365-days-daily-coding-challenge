#### Problem 14

# This problem was asked by Google.

# The area of a circle is defined as r^2. Estimate \pi to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.

# Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 = r^2

        y_rand = random() * radius
        if (x_rand ** 2) + (y_rand ** 2) < rsquared:
            pi_counter += 1

    return 4 * pi_counter / num_random_tests


assert round(estimate_pi(100000000), 3) == 3.141
