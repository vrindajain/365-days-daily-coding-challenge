# 365-days-daily-coding-challenge


I have set myself a resolve to code every day. I hope this would help enhance my programming skills & keep me motivated.

To hold myself accountable I chose to do this with the #365DaysDailyCodingChallenge. 

The principle is that you code for at least an hour each day for 1 complete year and log your progress. 

The challenge aims to create a community where you feel supported and encouraged, sharing help or advice to other members over social media platforms, all through the hashtag #365DaysDailyCodingChallenge.

I will be sharing my everyday coding problems with everyone, so join me on the journey.
